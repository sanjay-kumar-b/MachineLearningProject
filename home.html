            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Liver diseases averts the normal function of the Liver. Mainly due to the large amount of alcohol
                consumption liver disease
                arises. Early prediction of Liver disease using classifcation is an efficacious task that can help the
                doctors to diagnoise the disease
                with in a short period of time. Discovering the existence of Liver Disease at an early stage is a
                complex for the doctors. The main objective
                of this paper is to analyse the parameters of various classification algorithms and compare with
                predictive accuracies so as to find out the best classifer
                for determining the liver disease. This paper focuses on related works of various authours on liver
                disease such that algorithms were implemented
                using weka tool that is a machine learning software written in Java. Various attributes that are
                essential in the prediction of liver disease
                where examined and the data set of liver patients also evaluated. This paper compares various
                classification algorithms such as random forest,
                KNN,logistic regression and seperation algorithm with the aim to identify the best technique. Based on
                this study,KNN with the highest accuracy
                outperformed the other algorithms and can be further utilised in the prediction of liver disease
                recommended.</p>
